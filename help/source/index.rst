Functionality
=================

- The QGIS NNPlugin can be used to join two vector layers (the *input*
  and the *join* layer).

- All geometry type combinations are supported.

- A feature from the *input* layer is joined to the nearest
  feature in the *join* layer.

- The result of the join is a new vector layer with the same
  geometry type and coordinate reference system as the *input*
  layer.

- Joining layers with different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) is
  supported, as long as the join layer coordinate system is a
  projected CRS.

  - A warning is given when the user attempts to join layers with
    different CRS.
  
  - The join and distance calculations is performed using the join
    layer CRS.

  - Joining layers with an unprojected CRS is allowed, but the
    distance calculations are then done using decimal degreees, and
    the distances returned will be in decimal degrees.

  - The join will fail if the transformation of an input feature
    geometry to the join layer CRS fails.

- Self joins are supported.
  For self joins, each feature in the layer is joined to its nearest
  neighbour within the layer.

- A spatial index (QgsSpatialIndex) on the join layer is used to
  speed up the join for layers with non-multi-geometry types.

The result layer
=================

The result layer will contain all the attributes of both
the *input* and *join* layers plus a new attribute that contains
the distance between the joined features (the default name of the
distance attribute is "distance", but can be changed by the user).
The attributes from the *join* layer will get a prefix
(the default is "join\_", but this can be set by the user).
If a join prefix is not used, attributes from the join layer that
have the same name as an attributes in the input layer will not be
included in the output layer.
The result layer will have the CRS of the input layer, but the
distances will be according to the join layer CRS and use the join
layer CRS unit.

Options
=============
- The user can choose if only selected features are to be considered,
  both for the input and join layer.

- The user can choose to use an approximation of the input geometry
  (the centroid - *QgsGeometry.centroid*) to allow the use of spatial
  indexes also for non-point input layers.

- If the input layer is a point layer and the join layer is not a
  point layer, the user can choose to base the join on the simplified
  geometries of the spatial index for the join layer.
  The results will not be exact, but the speed should increase.

- The user can choose not to use a spatial index on the join layer
  for non-point input layers.

- The user can specify the prefix of the join layer attributes in the
  output layer.

- The user can specify the name of the attribute that will contain the
  distance to the nearest neighbour.

- The user can specify the name of the result layer.

Performance
===============

Below is a table that cross tabulates *input layer* (rows) and
*join* layer (column) geometry types, and indicates the usefulness
of the plugin (**OK** - the operation has time complexity O(*N*\ log\ *M*\ ) /
O(*N*\ log\ *N*\ ), or **Slow** - the operation has time complexity O(*NM*\ ) /
O(*N*\ :sup:`2`), where *N* is the size of the input layer and *M* is the size
of the join layer).

Implementation
================

Looping through the features of the *input* layer, the nearest
neighbour to each feature is identified in the *join* layer.

Without the use of an index, the geometry of each feature of the
input layer has to be compared to the geometries of all the
features in the join layer.
This takes a lot of time for large datasets.

A spatial index on the join layer will normally speed up the join.
*QgsSpatialIndex* provides the *nearestNeighbor* function, and
this function returns the nearest neighbour(s) to a given point
among the index geometries (which are approximations of the
real geometries).

For input layers with geometry type point (or centroid
approximation), a spatial index on the join layer will always be
used.

The *nearestNeighbor* function of *QgsSpatialIndex* only works on
points.  By approximating non-point input layer geometries by their
centroid, the spatial index can be used to speed up the join.

For layers with multi-geometries, spatial indexes are not used.

For input layers with non-point geometry type, the user can specify
that the geometry centroids are to be used for the join by checking
"Approximate geometries by centroids".
This means that the join will not be exact with respect to the
original input layer geometries.

For join layers with geometry type other than point, the user can
choose to do an inexact join based on the join layer index
geometries to speed up the join by checking "Approximate by index
geometries".

Spatial index
--------------

When a spatial index can be applied, the
*QgsSpatialIndex.nearestNeighbor* function of the join layer index is
used to find the nearest neighbour for each input feature.

- For join layers with point geometries, the index will give an exact
  answer.

- For join layers with non-point geometries the index will give an
  approximate answer (based on the index geometries which are
  approximations of the real geometries).
  This approximate answer is used to find all potential neighbours
  using the *intersects* function of *QgsSpatialIndex*, and among
  them the nearest neighbour is found using *QgsGeometry.distance*.

- For input layers with non-point geometries, the index is used to
  find a possible nearest neighbour based on the centroid of the
  input geometry.  The geometry of this possible nearest neighbour is
  then used in combination with the input geometry to determine a
  search region.  The search region is used to find all potential
  nearest neighbours and then find the closest one using
  *QgsGeometry.distance*.

Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)
---------------------------------------

If the input and join layers have different Coordinate Reference
Systems (CRS), the input geometry is transformed to the join layer
CRS before the join is performed.

The join will fail if transformation between the input layer CRS and
the join layer CRS is not possible.

**The join layer should have a projected CRS**.
